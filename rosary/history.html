<h3>The 15 Promises of the Rosary</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Those who faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.</li>
  <li>I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.</li>
  <li>The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against hell. It will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.</li>
  <li>The recitation of the Rosary will cause virtue and good works to flourish. It will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God.
  It will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities, and will lift them to the desire of eternal things.
Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.</li>
  <li>The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.</li>
  <li>Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries shall never be conquered
  by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just he shall remain
in the grace of God, and become worthy of eternal life.</li>
  <li>Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the sacraments of the Church.</li>
  <li>Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and
  plentitude of His graces; at the moment of death they shall participate in the merits of the saints in paradise.</li>
  <li>I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.</li>
  <li>The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.</li>
  <li>You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.</li>
  <li>All those who propogate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.</li>
  <li>I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire
  celestial court during their life and at the hour of death.</li>
  <li>All who recite the Rosary are my sons and daughters, and brothers and sisters of my only Son, Jesus Christ.</li>
  <li>Devotion of my Rosary is a great sign of predestination.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Prayers of the Rosary</h3>

<h4>Our Father</h4>
<p>One of my favorite resources is Ascension Presents. Check out their video explaining the "Lord's Prayer" here:</p>

<p>Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
  Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us;
  and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.</p>

<h5>Hail Mary</h5>
<p>If you've ever wondered how Catholics came up with the Hail Mary prayer, please watch the following video explanation:</p>

<p>Hail Mary, Full of Grace, The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
  Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of our death. Amen.</p>

<h5>Glory Be</h5>
<p>Glory Be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now,
  and ever shall be, world without end.</p>

<h5>Hail Holy Queen</h5>

<p>Hail, Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy,
our life, our sweetness and our hope.
To you do we cry,
poor banished children of Eve.
To you do we send up our sighs,
mourning and weeping in this valley of tears
Turn then, most gracious advocate,
your eyes of mercy toward us,
and after this exile
show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb,
Jesus.
O clement, O loving,
O sweet Virgin Mary.</p>

<p><strong>Lead:</strong>Pray for us, O holy Mother of God.
<strong>Reponse:</strong>That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.</p>

<h5>Oh My Jesus</h5>

<p>O my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fire of hell, lead all souls to heaven,
  especially those who are in most need of Thy mercy.</p>

<h5>St. Michael</h5>

<p>Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the wickedness
  and snares of the devil; May God rebuke him, we humbly pray; And do thou, O Prince of the Heavenly
  Host, by the power of God, thrust into hell Satan and all evil spirits who wander
  through the world for the ruin of souls. Amen.</p>
